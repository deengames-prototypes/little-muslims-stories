Little Muslims' Stories

Listen (and maybe read along) to bedtime stories for kids! 

- No internet required
- Moral and ethical stories instil solid character values
- Bi-lingual stories teach Arabic (or English)

TODO:
- Listen to original stories
- Immersive background audio makes kids feel like they're there
